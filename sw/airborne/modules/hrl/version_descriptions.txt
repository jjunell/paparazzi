Q-learning HRL with options

Start from simpler functions:
hrl.c_sim   -  good for sim and optitrack without vision.
    * note: current version doesn't write the full Qfnc and kq variables, working on it.
    
    * for sim use with nps target - airframe file: sim_hrl_b, and flight plan: rotorcraft_hrl_sim
    * for optitrack use ap target - airframe file: sim_hrl_b, and flight plan: rotorcraft_hrl_optitrack
    
hrl.c_vis_1c  - with optitrack and with vision module version 1: detects only red flowers and then determines which flower it's at by the state

hrl.c_vis_4c  - with optitrack and with vision module version 2 , using module detect_reward_4c:
    * detects 4 different colors and identifies which flower/hive it's at based on color (yellow, red, blue, purple)

hrl.c_test1 (tentative)-  learning from scratch in reality
hrl.c_test2 (tentative)-  learning from flawed simulation
   * receives Q-function from simulation at t_nr = 12, then learns in real world where t_nr = 5
   * receives Q-function from simulation at t_nr = 5, then learns in real world where t_nr = 12
