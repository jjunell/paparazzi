Q-learning HRL with options

Start from simpler functions:
hrl.c_sim   -  good for sim and optitrack without vision.
    * note: current version doesn't write the full Qfnc and kq variables, working on it.
    
    * for sim use with nps target - airframe file: sim_hrl_b, and flight plan: rotorcraft_hrl_sim
    * for optitrack use ap target - airframe file: sim_hrl_b, and flight plan: rotorcraft_hrl_optitrack
    
 

hrl.c_vis1  - with optitrack and with vision module version 1: detects only red flowers and then determines which flower it's at by the state
hrl.c_vis2  - with optitrack and with vision module version 2: detects different colors and identifies which flower/hive it's at based on color
